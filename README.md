# hello-world
Just another repository
My name is Derek. I am attending Northwestern University and I'm learning how to code. I want to learn to become more valuable in the professional field even though I'm most likely going to be a consultant or an entrepreneur (maybe both at one point). I also just want to learn how to make some pretty cool projects! I can't wait to learn!
